# How likely are you to accept a full-time offer at Anthropic?

Very likely. Anthropic is where I want to do this work.

I've built alignment verification tools independently because I believe the problem is urgent and tractable. But the highest-impact version of this research happens at frontier labs with access to state-of-the-art models, serious compute, and researchers working at the edge of what's known. Anthropic is the organization most aligned with how I think about safety: empirical, engineering-minded, focused on building things that actually work rather than theoretical exercises.

My academic positions have been valuable for developing ideas and running initial experiments, but they're not where alignment research will be won or lost. A full-time role at Anthropic would let me work on the problems that matter most with the resources and colleagues to make real progress. That's what I want.
