## Research Focus

I develop rigorous, empirically falsifiable frameworks for AI alignment verification. My core contribution is **Philosophy Engineering**—transforming unfalsifiable ethical claims into testable engineering properties. Rather than asking whether an ethical theory is *true*, I build systems that test whether AI judgment maintains *consistency*, *non-gameability*, *accountability*, and *non-triviality* under adversarial conditions.

My work addresses a critical gap: we cannot directly verify AI alignment, but we can measure alignment *failures* through symmetry violations, incoherence detection, and adversarial probing. This provides actionable safety signals for deployment decisions.

## AI Safety Research Program

### The Unified AI Safety Stack

An 8-layer architecture (L0–L7) for AI ethics verification, modeled on OSI networking:

| Layer | Name | Function |
|-------|------|----------|
| L7 | Geometry of Good | Real-world deployment under irreducible uncertainty |
| L6 | ErisML | Machine-checkable specification of norms and constraints |
| L5 | Translation Layer | Converts ethical frameworks to formal specifications |
| L4 | Philosophy Engineering | Transforms philosophy into testable engineering claims |
| L3 | GUASS | Integration hub connecting verification components |
| L2 | Noether Ethics | Symmetry-based coherence detection via Bond Index |
| L1 | Quantum Normative Dynamics | Superposition model of ethical states |
| L0 | Pragmatist Rebuttal | Engineering risk foundation |

### The Bond Invariance Principle (BIP)

Core falsifiability mechanism measuring whether ethical judgment maintains coherence across semantically equivalent inputs. The **Bond Index** (Bd = D_op / τ) quantifies three defect types:
- **Ω (Commutator)**: Transform order sensitivity
- **μ (Mixed)**: Context-dependent inconsistency
- **π₃ (Permutation)**: Three-way composition failures

Calibration suite: 10,500+ test cases across 18 parametric transforms at 5 intensity levels.

### DEME: Democratic Ethics Module Engine

Three-layer safety architecture:
- **Reflex** (<100μs): Constitutional constraint vetoes
- **Tactical** (10-100ms): Full MoralVector reasoning across 9 ethical dimensions
- **Strategic** (seconds-hours): Policy optimization with audit trails

**MoralVector dimensions**: Physical harm, rights respect, fairness/equity, autonomy respect, legitimacy/trust, epistemic quality, privacy, societal impact, procedural legitimacy.
