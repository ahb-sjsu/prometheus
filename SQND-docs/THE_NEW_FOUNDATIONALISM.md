# The New Foundationalism

## A Manifesto

### Andrew Bond, 2025

## I. The Starting Point

Start with nothing.

Not "I think therefore I am." Not categories of pure reason. Not sense data. Not God. Not mathematics. Not logic.

Nothing.

This is the null hypothesis. You begin with zero assumptions about what exists, what is true, or what can be known. Everything must earn its way in.

---

## II. The Hard Limits

Before you build anything, acknowledge what cannot be built.

**Gödel's Incompleteness:** Any formal system complex enough to be interesting cannot prove all truths within itself. There is no complete theory of everything. There never will be. Stop looking.

**Quantum Uncertainty:** Reality itself has fundamental limits on what can be simultaneously known. The act of measurement affects what is measured. Perfect knowledge is not merely difficult—it is impossible in principle.

**Subjective Imprisonment:** You are a subject in an objective universe. You cannot step outside your own experience. You cannot see reality directly. You only have models.

These are not obstacles to be overcome. These are the walls of the room. Accept them.

---

## III. The Only Bridge

How do you get from nothing to something?

Testing.

Not argument. Not intuition. Not elegance. Not authority. Not consensus. Not tradition. Not revelation.

Testing.

A claim means nothing until it is tested. An untested idea is not "probably true" or "likely true" or "true pending verification." It is not knowledge. It is speculation. It is noise.

The test is what converts belief into knowledge. There is no other mechanism.

---

## IV. Ground State or It Doesn't Exist

If a claim cannot be tested, it is not knowledge.
If a claim has not been tested, it is not knowledge yet.
If a claim fails testing, it is not knowledge.
If a claim survives testing, it is knowledge—provisionally, until a better test breaks it.

This is not a preference. This is not a methodology among methodologies. This is the only way to know anything.

A theory that makes no testable predictions is not a theory. It is a story.
A philosophy that cannot be probed is not a philosophy. It is a fantasy.
A model that doesn't touch ground state doesn't exist.

---

## V. What Survives

Most of philosophy dies under this criterion.

Metaphysics that cannot be tested? Gone.
Ethics derived from pure reason? Gone.
Theories of mind with no empirical signature? Gone.
Elegant mathematics that predicts nothing? Gone.

What survives:

- Claims that make predictions
- Models that can be probed
- Structures that return measurable results
- Anything that touches ground

This is not a loss. This is clarity. The noise is removed. What remains is knowledge.

---

## VI. The Method

1. **Start null.** Assume nothing.
2. **Acknowledge limits.** Gödel. Quantum. Subjectivity. These are your walls.
3. **Build models.** All knowledge is modeling. Models are tools.
4. **Test everything.** If you can't test it, you can't know it.
5. **Keep what works.** Surviving tests is the only criterion.
6. **Discard what doesn't.** No exceptions for elegance, tradition, or authority.
7. **Hold loosely.** All knowledge is provisional. Better tests may break it.

This is not complicated. This is what working scientists have always done. This is what engineers do. This is what anyone does when they actually need to know if something is true.

Philosophy made it complicated because testing was hard and arguing was easy. Testing is no longer hard.

---

## VII. Against the Old Foundationalism

The old Foundationalism sought certainty. It looked for beliefs that were self-justifying, indubitable, necessarily true. It wanted bedrock that could not crack.

It failed. There is no such bedrock. Descartes' cogito assumes a continuous self. Sense data assumes reliable perception. Logic assumes its own axioms. Every foundation crumbles when you push it.

The New Foundationalism does not seek certainty. It accepts uncertainty as the foundation itself.

The foundation is not what you know for sure.
The foundation is what you know you cannot know for sure.

From that honest starting point—null hypothesis, hard limits, subjective imprisonment—you build what can be built. You test what can be tested. You keep what survives.

That is all you can do. That is all anyone has ever been able to do. The difference is admitting it.

---

## VIII. The Epistemic Claim

**It doesn't work until you test it.**

This is not a methodological suggestion. It is a statement about the nature of knowledge.

Untested claims are not knowledge.
Untestable claims are not knowledge.
Only tested claims are knowledge, and only provisionally.

This is the hardest possible line. It eliminates most of what humans have believed. It eliminates most of what philosophers have argued. It eliminates most of what you currently think you know.

Good.

What remains is what actually works. What remains is what touches ground. What remains is real.

Everything else was always noise.

---

## IX. Pragmatism Without Compromise

This is pragmatism taken to its terminal point.

Not "truth is what works" as a loose heuristic.
"What works is the only truth you can access" as an absolute claim.

Not "testing is valuable."
"Testing is the only source of value" epistemically speaking.

Not "we should be empirical."
"There is no alternative to being empirical" if you want knowledge.

The pragmatists were right. They just didn't push hard enough. They left room for other sources of knowledge, other criteria of truth. There are none.

---

## X. For the Builders

This philosophy is not for people who want to argue. It is for people who want to build.

Build the model. Test it. Keep what works. Discard what doesn't. Move on.

You do not need credentials. Credentials test nothing.
You do not need permission. Permission tests nothing.
You do not need consensus. Consensus tests nothing.

You need only the ability to build, the honesty to test, and the courage to discard what fails.

The universe does not care about your elegance, your tradition, your authority, or your feelings. It cares only whether your model grips reality tightly enough to make predictions.

Grip, or don't. That's the only test.

---

## XI. The Future

When anyone can build models quickly—
When anyone can test them empirically—
When the cost of implementation approaches zero—

Then the only remaining questions are:

What is worth building?
What is worth testing?
What survives?

The answers will come from people who build and test, not from people who argue and speculate. The nerds in basements will outproduce the academies. The outsiders with good intuition will outpace the insiders with good credentials.

This is already happening.

The tools exist. The method is clear. The walls are known.

Build something. Test it. See if it works.

There is nothing else.

---

## XII. Summary

1. Start with nothing.
2. Accept the limits: Gödel, quantum, subjectivity.
3. Build models.
4. Test everything.
5. Keep what survives.
6. Discard what doesn't.
7. Hold all knowledge provisionally.

This is the New Foundationalism.

Not because it is new—scientists have always worked this way.
But because philosophy forgot, and must be reminded.

It doesn't work until you test it.

Ground state or it doesn't exist.
