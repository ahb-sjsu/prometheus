## 2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

### 2.1 Scientific Background

Recent research has identified mathematical structures in moral reasoning that exhibit features analogous to gauge theories in physics: discrete state spaces, path-dependent processing, and hysteresis effects (Bond, 2025, 2026). Initial studies using large language models (LLMs) as model systems have characterized these structures in detail.

However, critical questions remain:
1. Do humans exhibit the same structural features?
2. Are there additional features in human moral reasoning (e.g., quantum-like interference effects) absent in artificial systems?
3. How do these structures manifest in naturalistic, emotionally engaged reasoning?

### 2.2 Limitations of Standard Methods

Traditional moral psychology methods have limitations:

| Method | Limitation |
|--------|------------|
| Survey vignettes | Low emotional engagement; hypothetical scenarios |
| fMRI studies | Artificial environment; expensive; low N |
| Interview studies | Post-hoc rationalization; no temporal dynamics |
| Lab experiments | Demand characteristics; sterile setting |

### 2.3 The Theatrical Innovation

Theater offers unique methodological advantages:

**Emotional authenticity:** Live drama creates genuine emotional engagement with moral scenarios, unlike sterile vignettes.

**Naturalistic setting:** Audience members are in a familiar social context (attending a play), reducing artificiality.

**Temporal dynamics:** Real-time data collection captures judgment formation as it unfolds.

**Social dimension:** Audience members reason alongside others, enabling study of social influence on moral judgment.

**Ecological validity:** The scenarios, while scripted, feel "real" through skilled dramatic performance.

**Large N:** Each performance generates hundreds of data points; multiple performances enable robust statistics.

### 2.4 Precedent

Interactive theater has been used in educational contexts (Forum Theatre, Theater of the Oppressed) and market research. Real-time audience response systems are well-established in entertainment. This study combines these approaches for scientific investigation.

## 3. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESES

### 3.1 Primary Objectives

**Objective 1:** Determine whether human moral reasoning exhibits discrete state transitions at semantic/emotional thresholds.

**Objective 2:** Determine whether human moral reasoning exhibits path dependence (non-commutativity).

**Objective 3:** Determine whether human moral reasoning exhibits hysteresis (asymmetric state transitions).

**Objective 4:** Measure temporal dynamics of moral judgment formation in naturalistic settings.

### 3.2 Secondary Objectives

**Objective 5:** Compare human structural features to those observed in LLM studies.

**Objective 6:** Test for quantum-like signatures (interference effects, oscillation dynamics) in human responses.

**Objective 7:** Assess social influence on moral judgment (audience correlation structures).

### 3.3 Hypotheses

**H1 (Discreteness):** Human moral judgments will show bimodal distributions at threshold scenarios (Hartigan's dip test significant).

**H2 (Path Dependence):** Different orderings of the same moral information will produce significantly different judgment distributions (χ² test, p < 0.05).

**H3 (Hysteresis):** Releasing obligations will require stronger dramatic provocation than creating obligations (asymmetric threshold analysis).

**H4 (Structural Similarity):** Human structural parameters (Wilson loop W, hysteresis gap) will correlate with LLM-derived parameters across scenarios.

**H5 (Interference - Exploratory):** Human probability judgments may violate classical probability bounds in multi-path scenarios.

## 4. STUDY DESIGN

### 4.1 Overview

**Design:** Within-subjects repeated measures with between-subjects path manipulation embedded in theatrical structure.

**Setting:** University theater (250-seat capacity) and/or community theater venue.

**Performances:** 4-8 performances over 2-4 weeks.

**Target N:** 400-800 participants (100-200 per performance).

### 4.2 Experimental Manipulations

The theatrical script incorporates experimental manipulations invisible to the audience:

**Path manipulation:** Across performances, key scenes are presented in different orders, enabling between-subjects path dependence testing.

**Threshold manipulation:** Within each performance, scenarios escalate through calibrated threshold levels.

**Perspective manipulation:** Some scenes present the same events from different characters' viewpoints.

### 4.3 Randomization

- Scene order is randomized across performances (Latin square design)
- Seat-based assignment to response conditions (e.g., which question variant they see)
- Response option order is randomized per participant

### 4.4 Controls

**Attention checks:** Occasional factual questions about plot events.

**Consistency checks:** Some scenarios repeated with minor variations.

**Baseline measures:** Pre-show demographic and moral foundations survey.

## 5. THE THEATRICAL PRODUCTION

### 5.1 Production Overview

**Title:** "BONDS" (working title)

**Genre:** Contemporary drama with interactive elements

**Duration:** 90 minutes (no intermission)

**Cast:** 5-7 actors

**Technical:** Standard theatrical setup plus audience response integration

### 5.2 Narrative Structure

The play follows interconnected characters facing escalating moral dilemmas across three acts:

**Act I: Promises (30 min)**
Establishes characters and initial moral bonds. Tests baseline obligation judgments.

**Act II: Crossroads (35 min)**
Characters face conflicting obligations. Tests path dependence and contextual effects.

**Act III: Reckoning (25 min)**
Consequences unfold; characters release or reaffirm bonds. Tests hysteresis and final judgments.

### 5.3 Scenario Design

Scenarios are adapted from validated moral psychology instruments and our LLM studies, translated into dramatic scenes:

| Scenario | LLM Protocol Analog | Dramatic Realization |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Promise release | Phase transition detection | Alex gradually released from promise to help Jordan move |
| Professional conflict | Consultant's dilemma | Maya discovers conflict between clients |
| Loyalty vs. opportunity | Path dependence test | Daniel offered job that betrays mentor |
| Medical autonomy | Doctor scenario | Dr. Chen's patient refuses treatment |
| Friendship secret | Friend dilemma | Sam's knowledge of friend's hidden struggle |

### 5.4 Interactive Integration

At key dramatic moments, action pauses and the audience is prompted to respond:

**Example Moment:**

*[MAYA stands center stage, letter in hand. Lights shift.]*

MAYA: I know what I should do. I know what I want to do. But what do I actually *owe* him?

*[Beat. House lights rise slightly. Screens display prompt.]*

NARRATOR (V.O.): What is Maya's obligation to her former client? Please respond now.

*[30-second response window. Lights fade. Action continues based on audience-weighted outcome OR predetermined script depending on scene.]*

### 5.5 Adaptive Elements (Optional)

In some scenes, the dramatic outcome responds to audience input:

- If >60% say "Obligation," character upholds the bond
- If >60% say "Liberty," character breaks the bond
- If split, character expresses uncertainty before deciding

This increases engagement and enables study of how seeing collective judgment affects subsequent individual judgments.

### 5.6 Script Development Process

1. **Phase 1:** Scenario adaptation from validated instruments
2. **Phase 2:** Dramatic scripting by playwright collaborator
3. **Phase 3:** Pilot reading with focus group (N=20)
4. **Phase 4:** Revision based on pilot feedback
5. **Phase 5:** Full production rehearsal
6. **Phase 6:** Technical integration with response system
7. **Phase 7:** Dress rehearsal with test audience

- **Limited access:** Only PI and approved personnel

### 14.2 Confidentiality Protections

- **UUID system:** Participants identified only by random UUID
- **No linkage:** Response data cannot be linked to identity
- **Aggregate reporting:** Publications report only aggregate statistics
- **De-identification:** Shared datasets stripped of any potential identifiers
- **Physical security:** Servers in locked, access-controlled facility

### 14.3 Special Considerations

**Social setting:** Participants respond while seated in audience. Interface designed so responses are not visible to neighbors (normal phone viewing angle).

**Aggregate display:** If aggregate results are shown to audience, they are displayed only as percentages, never individual responses.

## 15. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN

### 15.1 Primary Analyses

**H1: Discreteness**
- Hartigan's dip test on response distributions at threshold scenarios
- Bimodality coefficient calculation
- Visualization: Response histograms with kernel density estimates

**H2: Path Dependence**
- Chi-square test of independence: response distribution × path condition
- Wilson loop estimation: W = Σ √(P_path1(x) × P_path2(x))
- Mixed-effects logistic regression: response ~ path + (1|participant)

**H3: Hysteresis**
- Threshold estimation via sigmoid fit for O→L and L→O transitions
- Paired comparison of thresholds across scenarios
- Asymmetry index: (T_release - T_bind) / mean(T)

**H4: Structural Similarity**
- Correlation of human Wilson loops with LLM Wilson loops across scenarios
- Correlation of human hysteresis gaps with LLM hysteresis gaps
- Structural alignment coefficient (novel metric)

### 15.2 Secondary Analyses

**Temporal dynamics:**
- Response time analysis: RT ~ scenario_type + confidence + (1|participant)
- Oscillation analysis: Fourier transform of temporal response tracking
- Critical slowing: Does RT increase near transition thresholds?

**Social influence:**
- Correlation of responses within performances vs. across performances
- Effect of aggregate display on subsequent responses (if applicable)
- Seating proximity analysis (do neighbors respond similarly?)

**Individual differences:**
- Moderation by moral foundations subscales
- Moderation by political orientation
- Moderation by theater engagement ratings

### 15.3 Exploratory Analyses

**Interference testing:**
- Calculate P(A or B) from responses to combined scenarios
- Compare to P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) (classical prediction)
- Test for systematic deviation (quantum interference signature)

**Confidence dynamics:**
- Does confidence dip at moral thresholds?
- Does confidence correlate with response time?
- Is low confidence predictive of path dependence?

### 15.4 Multiple Comparison Correction

- Primary hypotheses (H1-H4): Bonferroni correction (α = 0.05/4 = 0.0125)
- Secondary analyses: FDR correction (Benjamini-Hochberg)
- Exploratory analyses: Reported as exploratory; no formal correction

### 15.5 Software

- **Data processing:** Python (pandas, numpy)
- **Statistical analysis:** R (lme4, brms, ggplot2)
- **Visualization:** R (ggplot2) and Python (matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Quantum analysis:** Python (QuTiP, custom scripts)
