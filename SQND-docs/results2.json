      "text": "I know this post sounds super petty, but this is the most ridiculous fight I've had with my boyfriend, and unfortunately it's where we're at.I \\[F28\\] have never shaved in my life. I think it's up to the person regardless, but I've also just never really had a lot of hair. My boyfriend recently stayed over and asked to borrow a razor. Since I don't shave, I didn't have one on hand, and apparently that grossed him out. He told me that it was unhygienic to not shave and we argued back and forth about the issue when I finally told him that I'd only start shaving my legs if he shaved his first. He called me immature and petty, whereas I think he's being super fixated on this weird thing. It honestly wouldn't really bother me to shave, but I'm just more irked at his statements where he basically called me dirty. I was serious though: I'll shave whenever he shaves too.We're at an impasse but I wonder if I *am* being a little too petty about the whole thing.",

      "title": "AITA for pulling my daughter from a waterpark trip because her teacher made her stay with a kid she doesn't like?",
      "text": "My daughter Bryn F9 is going on a trip to a nearby water park with her class next week. She loves water and has been talking about it for months, so I was a bit thrown off when she came home crying a few days ago and told me she didn\u2019t want to go. I asked her why and she wouldn't tell me because she thought I\u2019d think she\u2019s a \u201cbad person.\u201d When I finally coaxed it out of her, she said her teacher \u201cMs. N\u201d has forced her to be the \u201cbuddy\u201d of her classmate \u201cBen\u201d for the entirety of the trip. She was to ride the bus with Ben to and from the trip, eat lunch with him, and go on all the rides with him instead of spending time with her friends. She then said nobody likes Ben because he whines whenever they have to do work and picks his nose and wipes boogers everywhere.I was horrified, not only because Ms. N had made Bryn do such a thing, but also because she had made her believe she was a bad person for not wanting to. Unfortunately this wasn\u2019t my first experience with Ms. N, as she frequently used my soft-spoken, intelligent older daughter as a \u201cbehavior buffer\u201d for the naughty boys until I threatened to report her to the superintendent. It\u2019s clear to me that Ms. N is still too comfortable with enforcing archaic gender roles on her kids and forcing girls to do unpaid emotional labor for the sake of the boys.\u00a0I immediately sent Ms. N an email condemning her actions. She sent me back an email with a bunch of bs that basically ended with \u201cif Bryn goes on the trip, she has to be Ben\u2019s buddy.\u201d *Fine.* I informed her Bryn would not be attending then. I immediately booked VIP tickets the same day her class was going so she could still go to the park and see her friends.What happened next I wasn\u2019t expecting. Bryn is quite popular, so I have gotten to know a lot of the moms in her class. When I let them know what Ms. N did, some of them were so horrified that they also pulled their kids out of the trip. In total, eight kids (out of a class of twenty) are either not going, or going with us. Today I got an email from Ms. N saying that because almost half of the class isn\u2019t going, they either have to raise the cost for the other students or not go at all. She practically begged me to let Bryn go and tell all the other parents to let their kids go, promising she wouldn\u2019t make Bryn do anything she didn\u2019t want to do. I told her she should have thought about that before she tried to make my daughter do *her* job.\u00a0My husband said I was being a bit petty and that Ms. N clearly feels bad about what she did, and I should let Bryn go as I\u2019ve already gotten my way. He asked me if I really wanted to deprive children of what they\u2019ve been waiting for all year. The thing is, if this wasn\u2019t Ms. N\u2019s first offense I probably would have agreed, but she has a pattern of this type of behavior and hopefully this will put a stop to it. Plus, if she has to explain this to her superiors, I have receipts. Is my husband right? Or am I justified?&amp;#x200B;UPDATE: Bryn WAS the only student assigned a \"buddy.\" The rest of the students were free to do what they wanted.",

      "text": "Alright so my son (17) has weekly therapy appointments that I take him to. Unfortunately, my husband let our daughter borrow his car and then had an emergency at work so he had to use my car so my son and I had to take the bus. It wasn\u2019t ideal, but I\u2019d rather the bus than miss an appointment. While it isn\u2019t my place to share why he goes to therapy, I will say that he will often forget to eat. I usually make sure he\u2019s fed, but due to the mess in the morning, it slipped my mind. The bus wasn\u2019t too crowded but all the seats were taken. My son wasn\u2019t doing too well and I could tell he was feeling dizzy from hunger+the bus. So the second someone got off their seat, I sat him down. I then tried to find a chocolate bar I had in my bag. While this is happening, I noticed an elderly woman and her adult daughter standing beside us. I didn\u2019t pay much attention until the daughter tapped me on the shoulder. She asked if my son could move so that her elderly mother could have a seat. I felt really bad, I really did, but my son was not doing great and standing would make it harder. I had found the chocolate and he was eating it slowly but if he stood up right then, I can assure you he would\u2019ve fainted. I apologized to her and explained that my son wasn\u2019t feeling well. She rolled her eyes at me and said that she saw him standing earlier and that he\u2019s a young healthy teenage boy-he\u2019ll be fine. I apologized once again and told her that he wasn\u2019t feeling well and that if he was then HE himself would\u2019ve offered her a seat. The daughter told me to look at her mother and I admit, the poor woman looked really tired. But I couldn\u2019t. My son had started to lean against me so I told the woman one last time that I was sorry and to ask someone else.I then heard them both whispering and calling me an entitled bitch. And when we got off the bus, a woman that got off with us said that a teenage boy can handle standing more than an elderly woman can and that she hopes someone treats me like that when I\u2019m her age. My son was so out of it, I don\u2019t think he even noticed or cared but I can\u2019t get this off my mind. AITA? A totally unrelated woman thought I was along with the two.I wasn\u2019t sitting down and did not have a seat.",

      "text": "We live three blocks away from my parents and they see our kids almost every day.  Hey husband's parents live a couple of states away and only see the kids a few times a year. It's easy when we go see them since we only visit when the kids are off school.  But when they come see us it is at random intervals through the year.  Not a problem really they are excellent grandparents.  With one small exception. They think our rules go out the window when they visit.  It's mean that we don't make the kids their favorite food every day.  Why can't the kids watch tv with them before they do their chores and homework.  Why do the kids have to be in bed so early.  It drives me crazy that I'm the bad guy because my husband won't put his foot down so I have to do it.  They came last week.  On Monday ss soon as dinner was over they wanted the kids to pay attention to them. They wanted to take the kids to see Avatar.  On a school night.  My husband allowed it.  Last straw.  I told him that he knew that throwing the kids off there schedule screwed me over.  So I gave him the choice of either enforcing our rules or I would.  He said he would take care of it.  Second night there was a hockey game on.  He wanted to watch it with our son who loves hockey.  I reminded my husband that our son had chores to do and homework.  He said it was just a hockey game.  I told the kids to get their stuff.  I took them and a change of clothes and their homework to my parents house.  My mom and dad will watch them and then take them to school in the morning.  I went back home and they were waiting for me.  I'm being a controlling and abusive person by denying them time with the kids. I'm not the only person allowed to make decisions regarding the kids.  They came all this way to see them and I'm being a jerk by keeping them on a schedule.  Fine.  They are visiting for a couple of weeks.  Wednesday after I picked up the kids from school and dropped them off at home with my in-laws. Then I went out for the first time in ages.  I told my husband I would be out late and didn't want to wake anyone so I would be at my parents house.  Did the same thing Thursday through tonight.  My husband has been calling and texting and coming over to tell me I need to come home because the house is a disaster because his parents won't do anything.  They are in vacation and they are there to see the kids not clean up.  The kids are having a fun time with no rules and he has been contacted by the school because no homework was turned in on Thursday or Friday.  I didn't answer those texts.  I said I would be back after his parents left or he enforced the rules.  He said I was taking it too far and that it was affecting his work.  Honestly tough shit.",

      "text": "My daughter (16) and I have gotten into a massive fight. My daughter has always been a picky eater and we have always done our best to accommodate her (Feeding her before parties weddings etc ). The problem lies with my husband's upcoming birthday ( turning 50).The restaurant he has picked is very special to us. That is where we first met as children for a business deal our parents had and then we became best friends when he asked me out in that very restaurant and our first date was there. When he proposed to me and who catered our wedding, I told him I was pregnant and we held my daughter's 1st birthday there. Unfortunately, we couldn\u2019t go there a lot as we had to move for his job but basically, all the major events of our lives were held there. So for my husband's birthday to celebrate him turning half a century old, we want to go there.We once took our daughter there when she was 10 and she hated it. But now since she is 16 I thought she would have matured enough and it is not like I'm forcing her to eat. She has the option of eating at home and I've told her so many times that the restaurant does have food she likes to eat, but she claims that it smells bad. It is a seafood restaurant but we always sit outside at our usual table so I don\u2019t understand that.She says that we are being selfish but I told her it's not about her it's not her day. In anger, she has refused to talk to us and not doing her usual chores and is refusing to eat. My husband is heartbroken and thinks it is all his fault and wants to cancel but I think it will just fuel her brattiness. Today my husband had to work late so it was only my daughter and me. When I called for my daughter to come to eat she looked at the food and then took the plate and dumped it in the bin.I was shocked, food is valuable and she didn\u2019t have to do that. I snapped at her calling her a selfish insecure little brat. That she is not only hurting her father but ruining his birthday and it's not as if we are asking her to give up a kidney. That if she continues this behavior we will never fund her birthday parties ever again. She said that I am a terrible mother for saying that.I feel like I went overboard but that she is acting like a brat. AITA?Edit: I am sorry for the late reply I posted this and went to sleep, No my daughter does not have anything like autism or any food allergies, we tested her when she was 10.We can\u2019t leave her at home because this restaurant is across the country from where we a going to meet our family and according to our country's laws she is still not allowed to be alone for more than a day without parental supervision.We have never had a fight like this and she usually is a chill kid i have no idea what has gotten into her.Edit: The reason we are not too strict with our daughter's eating habits is that we grew up in houses that were verbally and physically abusive, and it affected my husband the most. We never had the chance to go to therapy because at first, it was not a thing then it was too expensive and well we figured we didn\u2019t have to.We did not want our daughter to be like us and we thought if she didn\u2019t cause tantrums who is it really affecting? But my daughter has always gotten good grades and has had a lot of friends so this behave is really unique ",

My wife gave birth on Wednesday and came home from the hospital on Thursday. The kids and I have been doing our best to keep the house as quiet and relaxing for her as possible.On Friday she asked me not to pick my youngest kids up, because she feels the house is already unbearable with three kids, and five is too much. I told her she knows that isn't possible. That's not how custody agreements work. Besides, how would that make my kids feel? She said she just gave birth, so her feelings are important. I said I'm not flaking on my kids, so we need to figure something else out.Friday when it was time for me to pick up all the kids my wife was napping. I didn't want to potentially wake her, so I told my oldest (he's 19) to hold the baby until I got back. When I got back with all the kids, my oldest and wife were screaming at each other. The best I can tell is that she woke up and went looking for me, my son told her where I went, she called me a thoughtless prick, my son called her a hateful witch, and then they started screaming at each other.I got the kids to all go outside for a bit while I talked to my wife. She said I was an unbelievably selfish asshole that couldn't even give her a break for one weekend. She said none of this would have happened if I hadn't insisted on picking up my younger kids.

We are staying here until I can get a remote job and he can get a better one where we can actually afford to save money to buy a house. We live in a 2 story house with unfortunately only one kitchen which is downstairs. My husband and I along with our children live upstairs and my parents live downstairs. We spend most of the day downstairs because my children enjoy spending time with my mother and she helps me out a lot with them. Anyway, we call the upstairs \u2018our house\u2019 and the downstairs \u2018their house\u2019. We offered to pay rent/utilities in the past but my father refused to accept any money from us, we insisted a few times but decided to let it go when he wouldn\u2019t budge. My father is a truck driver so he is home every 2 weeks or so. My grandmother from my mother\u2019s side is currently visiting from Europe so there\u2019s a lot of people in the house.We have 2 boys, a 2 and a half year old and a 9 month old. My 9 month old recently started crawling so I decided to get him a playpen for when we are downstairs.When  I wanted to assemble it downstairs but my father told me to go assemble it upstairs cause \u2018there\u2019s enough shit here that everyone trips over anyways\u2019.Okay no problem, I went upstairs and assembled it to which my mother got mad because I didn\u2019t assemble it downstairs as she and I discussed it before.My father threw a tantrum because I have so many baby things downstairs, and yes, there was a crib, a bouncer and now there would also be a playpen for the LO.My mother got upset and brought the playpen downstairs to which my father said \u2018oh yeah bring more shit here, there\u2019s not enough, with the crib and the bouncer and the toys, yeah why don\u2019t you bring that shit here too?\u2019This hurt me, because in not so many direct words,he basically told me that my sons stuff bothers him, it made me feel like my son\u2019s presence bothers him as well..So I got upset and removed EVERYTHING that was my son\u2019s and brought them upstairs. I was so pissed off about it,because no one ever thinks about my feelings, especially my father, he always says the most hurtful things and doesn\u2019t even care or realize how much his words hurt me..Anyway, a little after I brought everything upstairs, my grandmother came to me and told ME that I don\u2019t know how to act, I am disrespectful towards my father by doing that blah blah. Like, EXCUSE ME? NOW IT\u2019S SOMEHOW MADE TO BE MY FAULT?  I have changed my view of my grandmother after I had kids,my word means nothing when it comes to my children and what I say..the way my father talks to me like I\u2019m a doormat but if I stand up for myself SHE will be the first one to tell me to shut up because I\u2019m \u201ca child\u201d and that I shouldn\u2019t talk back..I am just so done with these people, I\u2019m actually considering moving to my inlaws who live in Germany just to get away.So, reddit, AITA?",

      "text": "I (16 genderfluid) was recently at a close relative's wedding with my family (just guests, not as part of the bridal party or anything). The dress code the bride told us (and that was on the invite) was that women wore dresses and men had to wear something similarly formal e.g. a suit.I am AFAB so was told I would have to wear a dress. I don't identify as a woman however, so I wasn't comfortable with this and asked for a potential compromise on my outfit. She insisted that I wore a dress.Cut to when my family were ordering their wedding clothes/figuring out their outfits. My parents asked if I had found anything suitable and I sent them a link to a romper that looks very much like a dress at first glance, it's genuinely not noticeable unless you look closely that the bottom part is not a skirt.We got the romper, it arrives and everything is fine. I wore it to the wedding and for the first part everything seems ok, until I am pulled along too hard by a kid and end up tripping and falling face first, sprawled out on the floor. As everyone nearby gathers around to see what happened, the bride notices that the bottom part of my outfit is shorts and not a skirt, and loses her shit and starts screaming at me that she made it clear I needed to wear a dress and that I was being selfish by going against her wishes on her special day. I'm pretty sensitive and also hate loud noise as I'm autistic, so I start crying because the mix of pain from scraping my leg and her loud voice yelling is enough to overstimulate me pretty badly. My cousin leads me away to treat my wound, the bride stalks off still fuming and won't speak to us for the rest of the night until we eventually leave at the end of the wedding.I was reassured by some members of my family that I didn't do anything wrong, but I'm still super hung up over it and wondering if it was bad of me to wear that.I'm happy to provide a link to my outfit if anyone wants to see it to gauge for themselves.edit: [this](https://imgur.com/a/tMYgVFL) was what I woreedit 2: not attending wasn't really an option, she was marrying a close family member and we were pretty much expected to be there. my parents said that i needed to come as welledit 3: this is the most feminine item I own by far, and the discomfort is mainly subconscious with dysphoria and all, and the being forced into a gender binary when that's not who I am. plus, i enjoy the security of not worrying if my skirt will fly up in the wind. i would've much preferred a pantsuit or something but knew that wouldn't go so this was the closest thing to fitting dress-code i could findedit 4: i am perfectly fine with providing photos of the professional photo prints they had done of the event when they are ready (as evidence), it just might take a while",

He apologized and brought gifts:\\- A new physical copy of my book. Now this needs an explanation: except for me, the only person who has a digital copy of my book is my older sister, Federica. Federica is a No-bullshit kind of person. If the chance of me forgiving Carl were 1 out of 10, the chance of my sister doing the same things were 1 out of 1000. When he told me he convinced my sister to give him a copy to reprint it I was astonished.\\- A full collection of figurines of the main cast of my story. There are 5 main characters in the story and only two of them were on the cover I printed, which mean that he read the book and drew/had someone else draw a sketch of the other 3 characters in order to make their figurine. They are 25cm tall and I admit they look really good.\\- He paid me back for the physical copy he destroyed. I asked him why he was giving me the money since he had just given me a new copy and his parents had already paid me. He said that the new copy was in place of the one he destroyed, while the money were an apology.He apologized for what he did that day and explained me his reasons ( a mix of jealousy and bad timing) . Things are still not completely fine but they are better. He thanked me for bearing his hobby all these years. I apologized for losing my temper and insulting his hobby. While I don't share his passion over figurines, I can understand how much and love he put in every one of them.He looked sincere in his apology and we parted amicably.I decided to give back to his parents the money they originally gave me as an apology. I spent a couple of hours choosing what to do with the 5 figurines he gave me. For now I put the 2 \"original\" on my desk and the other 3 on the top shelf of my library. I have to admit, having figurines made about my own book is really cool and I spent quite a lot of time looking at them in the past week.I want to thank all of you for your support on the original post.

      "text": " My husband (M36) and I (F36) have 2 kids, a daughter (F14) and a son (M13). Our daughter turns 15 later this month, and we had a birthday party planned for her but in light of recent events, we decided to cancel. Our daughter is friends with some popular mean girls. We are working on things like therapy and consequences. Unfortunately, her latest behavior was the worst yet. Our son is very sweet and hasn\u2019t run into any issues with him being mean yet. Our son met a girl on a cruise we went on in April of last year, the girl lives about 40 minutes away, so they don\u2019t go to the same school. My son and the girl hung out together the whole cruise and started dating soon after.His girlfriend is an absolute sweetheart, very bright and loves sports like my son. The girl is also Indian-American, she was born here and so were her parents but both sides of her family have relatives in India. The girl and her family went to India last month and my son was invited many months ago, we signed all the paperwork needed and he was able to go with them. They came back a few days ago, my son really enjoyed it and brought back souvenirs (some sports stuff) for himself and family members. One of those family members was our 5 year old niece, who is my sister and her husband\u2019s daughter. He had brought handmade dolls for my niece, my sister lives about 5 minutes away, my son sometimes babysits for my sister. They also have a son, which he also got gifts for. The issue is, the day he came back, my sister and husband came over with their son and daughter to get the gifts. My daughter had her friends over, while he was presenting the gifts, our daughter and her friends were in the living room with us, we could hear laughing when he presented the dolls and a few of the girls had their phones out. At the time, my husband and I thought nothing of it, we thought they were on TikTok. My sister, her husband and my husband and I eventually left the house to get food we ordered. We came back, they ate and left.The next day, I got a phone call from my sister saying that her daughter was asking her if the dolls were ugly, and she said my daughter said something about it. We immediately went to her room, asked her what happened, she giggled and refused to answer, when we asked for her phone, she refused, so we shut the Wi-Fi off until she gave in. She and her friends had posted an Instagram story making fun of the dolls. My husband and I decided that with her increasing mean streak, this was the final straw and told her that her friends were toxic and that she wouldn\u2019t have a 15th birthday party bc of her actions. When I called my parents to tell them the party was canceled, they got mad at me and told me I over reacted, my sister and other siblings are saying I\u2019m doing the right thing and our son told us he\u2019s giving his sister the silent treatment and is very mad at her.

      "title": "AITA for telling a guy to move his crying baby out of a quiet enclosure at the zoo?",
      "text": "I (19M) visited the zoo today with my family and we were checking out the koalas, who I was especially excited to see. You may not know this, but koalas apparently need over eighteen hours of sleep a day to function or else they can get quite unhealthy quite quickly, and so any exhibit of them at a zoo will often come with an expectation that you maintain a certain level of silence while observing them. This zoo today was no exception - you are made to go through two gates, both of which have signage saying \u2018Please be quiet, keep the noise down, silence please, etc\u2019 and then the door to the koala house itself has another sign: \u2018Please keep noise levels to a minimum\u2019. With all those reminders, I figured people would get the memo, but as soon as we entered the enclosure (which was a small room indoors with a glass window looking into the koala pen) I spotted a couple in their early thirties with two young kids and a baby. I somewhat apprehensively tried to observe the koalas (they were so cute and my little sister was happy to see them) but then, like clockwork, the baby starts crying. Hardly the baby\u2019s fault - it\u2019s a baby, they cry - so I gave the dad of the family the benefit of the doubt thinking he\u2019d either take the baby out or calm her down. A few moments pass; the baby gets more annoyed and cries louder. The koalas scurry away, hiding in their cubby holes, and others wake up from their sleeping.I give the dad the look. I feel like everyone knows the look - we\u2019ve either had someone give it to us or given it to someone else. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d ever been on this end of it, but I\u2019d definitely received some looks at times.Baby continues to cry. I (being a socially awkward autistic teenager) grapple with the idea that the dad might have missed my giving him the look so I do the classic: I shake my head and give a little sigh. No change. I throw another look his way - this time a little more firm - but I feel like I overdo it - my eyes are a little too intense, perhaps - because suddenly the dad is saying, in the voice of someone who\u2019s just gotten a lecture \u2018Well alright mate, it\u2019s just a baby\u2019 to which I reply with a gesture towards the sign \u2018Silence, please\u2019. \u2018But it\u2019s a baby!\u2019 he says. \u2018Well don\u2019t bring a baby in here\u2019 I reply, in a whisper. My parents jump on me, thinking I\u2019m out of line and the couple and their kids give me the filthiest of looks and leave the enclosure, leaving me feeling very tense.What do we think? I feel like this is a very common struggle in a public place where there aren\u2019t always members of staff to enforce the rules. We want to pick our battles, of course, but this family bringing their baby in spoiled my little sister\u2019s magical moment seeing a koala for the first time. Surely they should\u2019ve seen the signs and thought \u2018Probably best to not bring little Charlie in\u2019 or, if they really wanted to see the koalas, the dad could\u2019ve stayed outside with the baby and the mum and the kids could\u2019ve gone in.

      "text": "Backstory, when my daughter \u2018Georgia\u2019 was 13, her mother and I divorced. I didn\u2019t want to uproot Georgia, therefore they kept the house and I moved into a nearby apartment. My ex was a SAHM, I continued paying all the bills for two years. Currently, I\u2019m still paying only the mortgage. Georgia is now 17 and resides with her mother. 16 months ago I met my now girlfriend. During that time, I purchased a house to get out of my apartment. My girlfriend moved in a few months back. Prior to that, I introduced her to Georgia. As I expected, she had a very \u2018whatever\u2019 attitude. I understand changes such as these are hard for kids to cope with. Since the divorce, Georgia could come and go as she pleased. Since my girlfriend moved in though, Georgia became obnoxious with constantly trying to run her off and humiliate her. The first incident, Georgia came over one afternoon while I was at work to say when she got home from school the previous day, I was coming out of her mother\u2019s bedroom. She knew this was not true as I had been with her that entire day. I sat Georgia down for a serious reality check. Georgia was apparently snooping through our mail, she saw my girlfriend\u2019s DOB. For the record, we\u2019re 13 years apart both divorced with kids. Georgia asked my girlfriend, \u201cSo what do you see in my dad, a caregiver?\u201c One early Saturday morning she came over while we were still sleeping. She had brought empty Depends underwear boxes and stacked them in the living room. When we woke up, Georgia said, \u201cWow, so you wear Depends just like my grandpa does huh?\u201d Thereafter, Georgia would refer to her only as \u2018grams\u2019 or \u2018the old hag.\u2019 The next incident, she used our bathroom, said she \u2018stunk it up\u2019 and used some \u2018old lady smelling cologne\u2019 to mask the odor. It was actually very expensive perfume, Georgia sprayed about 70% of the bottle around the house.The final straw happened last weekend. Georgia came over for breakfast. At some point, she took my phone and sent her mother a message that read, \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about you, I want to work things out and get back together.\u201d She deleted the text from my phone. Unbeknownst to me, she had mother\u2019s phone on her. Took a screenshot then deleted the text on her mother\u2019s phone. Tuesday, she sent the screenshot to my girlfriend on her mother\u2019s phone and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I think you need to know.\u201d She then deleted that text as well. This nearly caused her to leave, exactly what Georgia wanted. I immediately changed the locks. Before I could speak with Georgia, she showed up and couldn\u2019t get in. She called, we both were pissed off for different reasons. I told her she\u2019s not welcomed at our house until she has a serious attitude change. Her mother called, said I traumatized Georgia, claimed the text incident was a load of shit that never happened (Georgia admitted it). My ex said to be prepared to pay for her therapy, because she\u2019ll need it after I put some tramp above my own child.",

      "text": "I (f33) have one sibling, an older brother, Dan (m36). Dan and I never had the closest relationship even when we were kids. I can't exactly pinpoint why but it was just the way it was.Our mum was a single mother, and our dad was in prison serving a long sentence, and only got out when I was 17 and Dan was 20.When we were kids, our mum was working two jobs as a housekeeper and as a school lunch lady to make ends neat. We were really broke.As soon as I turned 16, I got a job working in retail to contribute to the household and hopefully save up for university. I was starting to save up quite a sizable amount of money after a year.In that same year, Dan got one of his coworkers pregnant. Shortly after she gave birth, she was hospitalised multiple times with post-partum psychosis and eventually lost all custody of the baby. Dan took custody and so it was me, our mum, Dan and the baby in a two bedroom flat. It was feeling a bit crowded and cluttered and Dan vented to me many times about how he needs to get his own place.Dan was really struggling for money, he was working a minimum wage job and had all the baby expenses to worry about.When I was 17, Dan stole my debit card and bank details, and withdrew all of my savings, which was around \u00a32K. He put my debit card back in my wallet and then left the house with the baby and moved in with his new girlfriend.I felt so betrayed that he would just take something that I worked so hard for.My mum told me I was forbidden from going to the police about it, and told me to just let it go, as Dan is struggling and needed it. When I was old enough to go to university, my dad gave me money to go towards my expenses.I hadn't spoken to Dan since that day and Dan never attempted to speak to me either.Last week my mum tried to sneakily get me and Dan to meet up under the guise that we were just getting a normal dinner at a restaurant and he was in on it. I told them that I don't want to see Dan.Dan told me I need to grow up and I can't hold a grudge over this forever. It was such a long time ago and he was young and desperate, and he's still my brother. He said it's only money and I shouldn't be so materialistic.I told him it's the principle of it, that I'm his little sister and he stole something significant from me. He said I'm dramaticising the situation, and that he was in a rough patch and surely I could understand why he did it.No one in the family is on my side here except my dad and I'm wondering if I really am being so wrong and so cold-hearted.",

They're allowing Annie to bring her bf because she apparently feels the most comfortable around him, and he can support her if needed.I think it's hypocritical of them to allow Annie to bring her bf, but not mine. She would have her dad there, also us which is supposed to be the point of the family vacation. I told them I also feel comfortable around my bf, so if that's the reason he should be allowed to come too. Step dad said no, and mom said she gets my point but Annie isn't the same as us.I told them if they're going to change the rules like this, I don't want to go.Now mom is pissed at me and said I'm being selfish about our vacation.AITA?Edited to add, Annie is blind",

I have a 10 year old daughter from my first marriage and asked him to please put them up in his \"chill out\" room (where he games, does Fantasy Football, watches movies I don't wanna see, &amp; smokes) because I didn't really want her seeing them all the time &amp; she never goes in there. He put them all up in the living room anyway as a \"surprise\" so I could \"see how good they looked.\" I know he loves these things, but her paternal grandparents were coming to visit and I didn't want them staring at \"I Spit on Your Grave\" or \"Three on a Meathook\" when they came in and sat on the couch to watch her choir recital with us on the big TV. I asked him to please take them down before they got here, but they were still up on \"D-Day.\" So I very carefully took them all down while he was at work and put them back up in his chill out space, same way he had them on display in the LR: thumbtacks; I tried to put them back in the holes that were already there. He was sooooooo upset when he got home and saw. Said it was \"disrespectful\" and that some of them were valuable and he wanted to frame.He's kept them in there, but I can tell he's upset I don't want to \"show them off\" in more prominent parts of the house. He says since movies are just pretend it shouldn't bother my daughter and that some of these films are \"classics.\" He also reminded me she isn't here all the time because I share custody with my ex. I guess since he spent money on them and time hunting them down he wants them more on display.AITA for moving the posters?",

      "text": "I 23F recently got engaged to \u201cJim\u201d 25M. We don\u2019t like super extravagant weddings, so we plan to keep things simple and frugal. We received money from our families, but we\u2019re using it for a nice honeymoon and using our own bank accounts for the wedding day.Although the title may make it seem otherwise, my step-mother \u201cKim\u201d and I have a good relationship. She gave me a hefty amount of money and asked that I use it for a dress. She said she was very poor at the time of her first wedding and didn\u2019t get to wear a beautiful dress on her big day, and it would mean the world for me to get to wear one. I obliged. I wasn\u2019t planning on spending my own money on an expensive dress, but the amount of money she gave me the opportunity to wear my dream dress. She even took me dress shopping along with my grandmother and helped me pick the most perfect dress. It was a classic fit and flare, and with all the money I was able to get some custom embroidery done. Not only was it a beautiful dress, but it flattered my body perfectly.A few days after I picked out the dress, however, Kim approached me and asked me if I would like to wear her mother\u2019s old wedding dress from the 1970s, and said she\u2019d give me twice the money she had initially offered to do whatever I pleased with if I agreed. I turned her down. I know it\u2019s a lot of money, but the wedding will be a day I remember for the rest of my life and I really wanted to wear a dress that suits me. The dress in question was puffy with no shape\u2013it would be like getting married in a down jacket.When I said no, Kim explained that she sent me a photo of me in the dress to my step-sister \u201cBea\u201d 25F and Bea had a freakout and said she wouldn\u2019t come to my wedding if I wore that dress. Some background on Bea: our relationship was strained from the beginning. I had better grades than her, dated better looking guys, went to a more prestigious college, got a higher paying job, and I\u2019m now getting married to the guy we both liked in high school while she is still single. Plus, Bea is overweight and very insecure about how she looks, and has always taken out her insecurities on me. Kim said watching me get married to Jim would be hard enough, and I didn't need to wear a dress like that and make it worse.\u00a0I still refused to wear the old dress. I told her I\u2019m not going to compromise my wedding to coddle Bea\u2019s insecurities. She then asked for her money back and I said no, she gave me the money and the dress is already paid for.I left it at that but then I got a call from my dad telling me I was rude to Kim and Bea and that I should be able to compromise a small thing about an otherwise perfect wedding for Bea\u2019s sake, or at least pay Kim back the money for the dress. I *did* give her back the leftover money, which was a couple hundred dollars, but I refuse to give back the money I spent on my dress, or wear a different dress. Am I an AH for that?",

      "text": "I (25F) am getting married in September. My husband, Mike and I are doing a big wedding for 250 guests. I've always dreamed of having a storybook wedding. I asked my best friend Marissa (25F) to be my MOH and she happily agreed. She's been a huge help to me in every step of planning the wedding. Marissa is in a poly relationship and she has 3 partners. Greg (24M), Brandon (27M) and Ace (22NB). She's been with Greg for 5 years and was the first partner she had. They added Brandon and Ace over the course of their relationship with Ace being the newest member. They all date each other and seem to be happy. I don't really \"get\" it if I'm being honest but it's not my business. However the issue came into play when Mike (32M) pulled me aside and said while he loves Marissa he didn't feel like spending the wedding explaining her love life to his family. Which I understand, they are very conservative and hardly accept LGBT people as is let alone a LGBT polyset. I had already reserved 4 spots of Marissa &amp; co but my husband suggested he invite a few coworkers to take the partners spot and Marissa could come alone. I didn't want to ruin his big day so I agreed reluctantly. I know I should have told Marissa from the get go but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. So when invite went out she called me up immediately and asked why she didn't have a plus 3 invite. I explained to her exactly what I said above and she just said \"oh\" and hung up. Next thing I know Brandon is calling me and begging me to reconsider saying they promise they won't act like they are in a relationship but they want to be there for me. Except I can hear Greg in the background telling him tell me to fuck off and that I'm am asshole and he doesn't even want to go. I explain to Brandon that I already gave their \"spots\" to Mike's coworkers. Brandon says okay thank you and hangs up. Marissa texts me the next day saying she isn't coming unless they can go. Mike said he can't uninvite his co-workers now so it's not his problem. I told him I would add them and pay the costs and he just said if I want to spend the whole time explaining their relationship to people than so be it but he isn't wasting his time doing it and will just send people my way. Our other friends think I'm an asshole but Mike's friend and a few of my non mutual friends don't think i am. Just want some more unbiased opinions.Edit: I am the asshole, that's for sure. I followed a lot of advice in this post and asked Mike what he thinks in the morning. He said to talk to Marissa first and see what she wants and we'll make it work. I also had him read over the post himself and he said that a lot of the comments opened his eyes on how he himself was coming off. So we both decided to call Marissa together and beg for forgiveness. We called her and she was happy to talk. We explained our side of things but acknowledged that it was a massive fuck up and could have been handled so much better. We invited her and her partners, obviously and said we would be happy to whatever it takes to have them forgive us. She asked her partners about it and Brandon and Greg both agreed they would prefer to just \"split\" the set up. So Greg and Marissa would be a couple for the wedding and Brandon and Ace would be a couple. They however would need to talk to Ace first (they were at work) and that they would get back to me. So that's where we currently stand.Edit2: I never told Marissa I was inviting her partners, I just had a list of invites with Mike. I'm still the asshole but wanted to explain that.Last edit: Ace got out of work a few hours ago and we all got on speaker phone and had a long conversation with this post pulled up. The crew was all happy to be defended but did think people went a little harder than they would have even Greg. He actually laughed at me calling him self absorbed because he is lol. Anyway. We're all good :) they are coming. They gave permission to tell Mike's parents. We called them after and they understood but said don't let Nanni know or she'll be asking questions all night. It's been a huge relief and I think we learned how to communicate better as a couple.",

Here's the thing with Maya's mom. She recently became interested in homeopathic remedies and eastern medicine. We've gotten into arguments before about vaccinations and medicine for a chronic illness but as far as my husband and I knew, she didn't have a problem with short term otc meds like Tylenol or cold medicine so we agreed to let Maya stay with her mom. Maya texted me a couple days ago saying she wanted to come home. I asked if everything was okay and she said yes but she didn't want to be at her mom's house anymore and wanted me to pick her up. My husband was working late so I went to pick her up. Her mom didn't want to let me in at first but I eventually got to Maya. She looked horrible. Apparently her mom didn't know any \"natural cures\" for whatever Maya had but thought letting it run its course without any medicine would be healthier than giving her medicine.  I called my husband and he met us at the house and took her to urgent care. I'm taking some time off of work to take care of her while she recovers. The problem is her mom is furious with us for picking her up \"early\", keeping Maya home on her weekend, and for disregarding her input on Maya's health. AITA for picking her up early and keeping her here during her mom's weekend.",

      "text": "My wife and I have three children. My parents brought up five kids and my dad would call us our names, our nicknames, random names he thought we had, boy, girl, son, daughter, or hey you.  When we had our kids I did the same.  Until my oldest, my daughter, brought it up at a meeting with her counselor that it made her feel bad that I called her names like that.  So I stopped.  I talked to my sons and they both were fine with it.  Sometimes when I call out \"boy\" they yell back \"me boy or him boy\"?  But since that meeting I have never referred to my daughter by anything other than her name.  Other than that our relationship has not changed.  I accepted that she didn't want to be treated a certain way.  Last summer we had a family reunion.  My parents were the guests of honor since it was also their 50th anniversary.  We live across the country so it was the first time that my wife and kids were around so much of my family at once.  It was a great time.  And all my relatives were yelling for their kids constantly.  And my daughter was the only one that was only being called by name.  No one made a big deal about it or anything.   Last week I was asked to meet with her counselor again.  It turns out she is feeling excluded by my family because they don't call her girl or hey you.  She is mad at me for having fun nicknames for her brothers but only calling her by her name.  I asked if she remembers why that started.  She said that I embarrassed her in front of her friends by calling her girl.  And that she had asked that I call her by her name.  So now I'm confused.  She had no problem being called by her name for over a year.  Now that she has seen that is how my family is, which she knew before because we had gathered together before in smaller groups, she wants to be called nicknames and stuff again.  Which is fine.  So I asked if she wanted me to limit her nicknames to private family time?  For example when I take them to the movies I will call them by her name, boy number one, and hey you.  Which was something she had brought up as rude before.  She said I was cherry picking situations and that I should just know.  I don't since I cannot read her mind.  She is 16.  Her brothers are 14, and 13.  At the reunion my dad and uncles all referred to me as fat boy.  I'm 6'1\" and 275 pounds.  They are all short, jealous Hispanic, beanpoles.",

      "text": "Original post here:\u00a0/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yi5bty/aita_for_cancelling_a_trip_and_refusing_to_pay_my/People were so kind to me in the comments that I wanted to give an update on this. TL;DR I'm doing well but it's been a long couple of months![To the people who said Polly was lying about booking a flight because it seemed suspiciously cheap/she could've cancelled within 24 hours - she booked on a cheap UK airline and this is fairly standard pricing, plus their cancellation/refund policies are what you'd expect from an airline where they charge you extra just to sit next to the person you booked with! She's many things but not a total liar, she definitely booked after I told her not to.]After everything blew up with Polly, we didn't speak for a couple of weeks. I talked it over with my parents and they said that I was under absolutely no obligation to pay her a penny, which I agree with, as did all of this sub! However they suggested that I could offer to pay a small amount (like 20% of the fare) in the interests of salvaging the friendship. I liked this idea as I was still feeling so heartbroken and didn't want to throw away 10+ years of friendship if avoidable. So I sent her a message explaining that I didn't feel I owed her any money for her mistake, but that I really cared about her and our friendship and that I would be willing to make a small contribution if it meant that we could meet on happier terms in the future and resume our friendship.Well, she left me on read. For OVER A MONTH. She did eventually reply to tell me that I should still pay the full fare (claiming she was \"seconds away from booking\" when I originally spoke to her), and then messaged me a \"reminder\" of this a few days later. That second day was my birthday and she sent me no well wishes along with it, just a reminder that she wanted money. I'd finally been pushed over the edge, I was absolutely raging and told her it was unacceptable to message me shit like this on my birthday. That was the last time we spoke and I've now blocked her on everything.It also turns out she didn't tell as many of our mutual friends as I thought. One of them is no longer speaking to me, I've tried to reach out but she's ignoring me, so I'm leaving it because who needs people like that. Another pair had heard the story and said they want to \"remain neutral\", which makes me think they didn't hear the whole truth, but I can't be bothered to push it as they're still cool with me and don't really care about the Polly drama.I'm feeling great now, things are going well with my family and I am really enjoying my last few months of semester abroad, I've made some good friends and am having the best time. I wish all the drama had never happened, but I'm grateful to have seen the true colours of someone I would have continued to trust otherwise. Thanks for all the support on here.",

      "text": "My grandpa was a notoriously ungenerous man and the extent of his Christmas gifts most year were bargain bin age inappropriate toys for the kids and hallmark store tchotchkes for the adults, and a lottery scratcher for each person. What added insult was his stern insistence that if your scratcher won he wanted half the winnings. This was a common joke at his expense told behind his back. The Christmas after I turned 19 I got my first Christmas  scratcher. I didn't get one the year before because he forgot I was 18. It won 100 dollars. He asked me if it won and I lied to his face. I said it was a dud. Broke college student disinclined to share the winnings I told him no. I took my girlfriend out for a nice dinner with it. When the family found out I got the mother of all guilt trips. I was told to pay him back the 50 bucks I \"owed\". I refused, and thankfully they didn't pressure me further but the whole family said I was an asshole for lying to my grandfather intentionally. I say his gift was given in bad faith if he was gonna insist on taking half the winnings. This was many years ago and my grandpa has since passed. But my perfiddy is still brought up from time to time. I didn't get any scratchers again. AITA?EDIT: clarification. They found out because my girlfriend accidentally let it slip that I took her on a date with lotto winnings, not knowing that I had lied about it.",

I have 3 horses and I rent out 1 stall to my friends friend. This boarder brought me a very sick horse that I nursed back to health. I forced her to take care of some much needed veterinary things on the horse which saved its life. I am of the mind set that it is our responsibility to fix things before they become a problem. She is essentially a single mother with 4 kids and waits until things are really broken before she reacts. In other words, she has way different views of the world than I do. I am always expecting things to end up sideways in a bad way so fix things that look even a little fishy as a horse vet bill is never lower than $500. She waits until it must be taken care of before she reacts. She asked me if she could give kids lessons on my property to pay for things. I said sure as long as she had insurance to cover both my home and her. She also, could not let her students be alone on my property, and she had to keep everything picked up.Well, her under age students are being dropped off 60-45 minutes before she even shows up to play on my property. Things like brushes, tools, and saddles are left out all over. I reminded her about these things and she said she would fix it. My husband then asked if she really had insurance. I then asked her for proof of her insurance. She did not have any.I am pissed because she is leaving us vulnerable to a law suit and the possibility of loosing our home. I called my insurance company to make sure we were covered in the mean time, then asked the horse community what insurance she and I would need to make sure we don\u2019t lose our home if one of her students gets hurt. In the meantime, I asked her to stop lessons, or get insurance, or leave by March 1st. AITA for doing this?",

Let's call him Gray. It may not be something too deep so I was flattered. i let him know i wasn't interested since i just got out of a long relationship.A month after this rejection Gray asked me to be his girlfriend. Again, i rejected. He said it's cool, but he'd appreciate it if i didn't cut him off. I didn't, as he was a nice friend to have. I had to reiterate to him more than once after this that there is no chance i'm reciprocating the feelings at all.One day one of my closer coworkers let me know that Gray would ask her what my plans for the day were, and if i had any he'd ask where i'd be going and who i'd be with. He'd also ask her if i was hanging around any other male coworkers.One time when we were out for a lunch with the team, our boss gave us the rest of the day off. that meant we'd be free to go home or hang out after lunch. I told everyone i'd be off home as i was too tired. He offered to bring me home and i declined. He snapped and started almost begging to bring me home but i just kept declining. He then said fine let me book you a taxi home and proceeded to type my address correctly when i know for a fact i never gave him my address. I was majorly uncomfortable at this point.He's done weirder things over the past year - stalking my family on social media, memorizing usernames of my close friends on ig, he even found an old twt acc i wasn't using anymore, ship products he bought online directly to my address, even got on a taxi and followed mine home. When i confronted him about it he said he just wanted to make sure i was safe.Last week while preparing to go home it started to rain so he insisted to bring me home on his motorcycle. he followed me around the office just going \"please let me bring you home\". we were around other coworkers but i snapped at him and told him to f off and leave me alone in a rather high voice. a coworker (who was aware of the stories i told above) overheard and told me i didn't have to react that way. i talked to a (non coworker) friend about it and he told me this might be gray's way of \"winning me over\". now i'm worried that i'm just viewing him as annoying and stalker-ish bc i didn't reciprocate the feelings and went off on him when he was being kind.

      "text": "A little background: I am the proud (future) step dad of a 6 and 5 year old. I am engaged and getting married in a couple of months. I have known the kids and dated my fianc\u00e9 since our 5 year old was 1. Over two years ago the kids moved in with me and live with me and my fiancee full time. their dad only sees them about once every month. The kids go to school in our boundary school, and my fianc\u00e9e has primary placement. Between me and my fiancee we have taken on all of the responsibilities to raising our kids and their dad contributes nothing. Their dad has an open invitation to come pickup the kids every Sunday. However, we hardly hear from him and he does not see them as often as we would like.The part where I am wondering if AITA: on the days he wants to see the kids, he comes to pick them up. Every time, he knocks on our front door, and then comes inside even though the kids are fully ready to go shoes on and everything. He usually spends 5-10 minutes talking in the foyer and then they go on their way. When he returns with the kids, it is essentially the same thing, except he stands in the foyer and gives a long drawn out, emotional goodbye. He doesn\u2019t try to move things along and it\u2019s awkward to me that I have to be the one to encourage the kids to \u201csay goodbye\u201d and move on with our day and allow him to leave. Occasionally the kids want to bring him upstairs and show them a new toy or something in their bedroom. I am uncomfortable with this. I don\u2019t like the idea of my fianc\u00e9es ex coming into my house and in personal areas such as our upstairs. I vocalized to my fianc\u00e9e this and she agrees, but she doesn\u2019t want to make things in unnecessarily difficult for the kids so has taken no action on it. I understand. But\u2026The other day, after he dropped of the kids, after another long drawn out goodbye, I told the kids to head upstairs and get their pajamas on. I walked outside with their dad and suggested that instead of him coming inside every time that he say all of his goodbyes from the car. I said this with good intentions and implying that he deserves a good, and private goodbye with his kids without me or my fianc\u00e9 lingering around. I suggested once he is done with his good bye, the kids can walk up to the steps and wave when they get inside. To me this makes things easier on everyone and I don\u2019t have to have my personal boundaries violated. His only response was that he doesn\u2019t get to see them much and that he didn\u2019t realize it was a problem bringing them up to the door. (Reminder he has the opportunity to see them every week but he never does). AITA for telling him to stop coming in my house?",

      "text": "I (32F) am getting married in September. We have started to get stationary orders together and we\u2019ve run into an issue that has our families split. My fianc\u00e9 (34M) and I are not very traditional, and our wedding is going to have some unorthodox aspects. In addition to an open bar we\u2019re also doing a cannabis bar, and the desserts are coming from a vegan bakery (we\u2019re not vegan, we just like this bakery). My parents are quite conservative and his are less so but still lean towards that end.The issue is that I want to include a note with the invitations asking people not to wear pastel colors to the wedding. My bridal party is wearing pastels (they were able to choose their own dresses/outfits) and my wedding dress is blush pink. The tradition is that you don\u2019t wear white to a wedding, but I don\u2019t really want someone to show up and accidentally match my or my attendants\u2019 clothes because they were avoiding white. My fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t know that my dress is pink but he was fine when I explained about the bridal party. Both of our sibling groups also thought it was a good idea.His parents were not enthusiastic about it and my parents were downright offended. His mom basically told us we can do whatever we want but we\u2019re going to look incredibly rude for dictation what people wear to our wedding as guests. My mother screamed at me and called me an entitled brat. She said with the type of wedding we\u2019re having we have no right to ask anything of our guests, and we \u201cshould just be thankful people are coming because no one wants to smell dope at a wedding reception.\u201d When I told her my dress wasn\u2019t white she yelled at me about that too and then kicked me out of her house.I\u2019ve been rethinking the entire wedding. My fianc\u00e9 and I are cannabis enthusiasts and he runs a dispensary, but I can see how maybe some people won\u2019t enjoy that aspect so maybe my mom is right and we shouldn\u2019t have it. It would make me sad but I think I understand. I also am second guessing my choice of dress. My mom wasn\u2019t there when I chose it and she would have had a problem with it (kind of why I didn\u2019t invite her to come in the first place) but maybe she\u2019s right. It\u2019s not a black tie affair so maybe I shouldn\u2019t ask people to wear specific things.WIBTA?Edit: For those asking, yes the wedding is explicitly child free. No one under the age of 21 will be allowed into the event and we have already contracted a security guard to enforce this. Also, we are well aware that many people will not want to attend and we are fine with that. Most of my family lives on the other side of the country and we are planning a bbq next summer to celebrate with them. We expect about 40 people (our friends and some of his family) to attend and they are all cannabis-friendly.The wedding is being held on our property and all of the cannabis will be kept and consumed outside. There will not be edibles available, and all of this will be be explained on the invitations.Also this is the text that we wanted to put on the invitations about the dress code:\u201cAs you know, we have always enjoyed things that are outside of tradition. As such, you may see the bridal party incorporate some non-traditional colors for the ceremony, and we\u2019re asking guests to please avoid wearing light pastel colors.\u201d",

      "text": "I (26F) have a 18 month old with my ex-partner (33M). We were together for two years when I found out I was pregnant. It was unplanned and I was hesitant because I didn't think we were ready to be parents. I wanted kids but I work in a field I had to train in for years, my job is super stressful and tiring, and at the time I got pregnant I'd just moved up but still wasn't making a huge amount of money and needed to carry on putting in a lot of work to progress further. He was the opposite and really excited and wanted us to start a family and we basically talked it through and (naively) I changed my mind based on his reaction.His job is kind of intense and at times dangerous and takes him out of the country for a few months at a time regularly. When I was 16 weeks pregnant he went away for work and was gone for three months. We'd text and call whenever he was able to but a few weeks into him being away he stopped answering my texts and would keep calls super short. I thought something bad happened in his work situation and chalked it up to that. When he got back he was completely off and we started bickering a lot about small things. At this point I was 7 months pregnant, experiencing pregnancy complications, and becoming really dependant on him. Just over a month before my due date he told me he couldn't do this anymore and left, went no-contact with me. I had the baby by myself, my mum and sister helped me out a lot and still do but I've been my son's primary caregiver this entire time.A few months ago he got in contact with me to talk and explain himself. I wasn't trying to be difficult or petty, but I said no because I just wasn't in the right mind space to see him because I think I honestly kind of processed everything by reacting like he'd died and hadn't been thinking of him as a person who was still existing somewhere. After that he showed up at my mum's house, my mum is extremely nice so she heard him out. She said he just wanted to meet the baby and talk things out with me. I felt guilty being the reason they couldn't meet so I said ok and he's been spending time with him semi-regularly since. Last week he told me he's going away for work for a few months again and wants to have the baby stay with him over the weekend before he goes. I said no because I don't know anything about my ex's home environment, I've never been away from my son overnight since he was born, and my ex has never had to look after him by himself before so I don't know what it would be like for him.I told him this but he said I'm just using my son to punish him by keeping them apart and that he isn't a pawn for me to use in my revenge game. I know it's wrong to let bad feelings between parents seep into kid's lives, and as much as I have my valid reasons for not letting him stay over I'm worried that I'm being too untrusting and deep down I'm letting our issues make decisions regarding my son's relationship with his dad.

      "text": "This happened on Thursday but my girlfriend still insists I acted like an asshole so I came here to get some outside perspective. We've been together for just over a year. We moved in together around 3 months ago, or rather she moved in with me. We were both single parents, I have a 14 year old daughter and she has a 16 year old daughter. Our kids never really got along, they're not hostile towards each other but they have completely different characters and don't really have anything in common. My daughter likes my girlfriend but my girlfriends daughter doesn't really like me. So I wasn't working on Thursday and decided to pick up the girls from school because I was bored (they usually get an uber). After lunch her daughter went up to her room as always while mine stayed in the living room watching Disney+. After about an hour or so she asked me if we could go shopping because she wanted to get some new shoes and other clothes. So I agreed and I told her daughter that we were leaving. The shopping took us longer than I expected and we came back after about 4 hours and by that time my girlfriend was already home from work. And when she saw all the shopping bags she got mad that I didn't take her daughter shopping too. We argued about this for a while and I told her that I don't mind spoiling my daughter but I'm not going to spend my money on her kid when she never spends money on mine. She then started pointing out how I make more than her etc etc and it became a whole thing. Was AITA here??",

      "text": "It has been my (F 32) mom\u2019s (F 72) lifelong dream to visit Paris. After going back and forth for a while, we finally set our dates to go in the fall of this year. After we chose our dates, my mom informed me that she had invited two other members of our family along with her best friend and her adult daughter (Kelly and Stacy) to come on the trip with us. Initially, I was fine with this plan, although I was admittedly a little hurt because I wanted this to be a special time for us but I didn\u2019t say anything. My family\u2019s had a tough time this last year, so if inviting more people makes my mom happy, then fine. I went ahead and planned my travel and chose corresponding flights (connecting with mine) for my mom and anyone else leaving from her state. I\u2019m a very relaxed traveler, I\u2019m not big on tourist sites or itineraries, and typically like to make travel plans and then go with the flow once I get to the destination. Last night, we had a call to discuss the trip and I felt like Stacy was being a bit overbearing in the conversation, suggesting that others fly out of an airport closer to her state (makes no sense as most are on the US East Coast and she is more inland) and that we look into working with a travel agent overall. I\u2019m a frequent traveler and more than capable of planning a weekend in a city I\u2019ve visited before, but after this phone call, I just kind of see things a spiraling out of control. What was supposed to be a relaxing long weekend with my mom is quickly turning into an unwieldy group-trip tourism monstrosity with an itinerary that just doesn\u2019t feel very fun for me. At this point, I\u2019m the only one who has booked a plane ticket, and I am planning to sit my mom down and tell her I\u2019ve changed my mind and no longer want to go on the trip with all these people. I\u2019m hoping that since it\u2019s so far away, people will be willing to pivot, perhaps to a trip closer to home at another time. I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings or my mom\u2019s relationship with Kelly, but I just am not willing to spend this amount of time and money planning a trip where I know there is high potential for me to not have a good time. Plus, I\u2019d admittedly just like to have the experience with just my mom and I. So Reddit, WIBTA?  TLDR; my mom invited a bunch of people on our dream vacation - I no longer want to go.",

We live in Colorado and, during winter, nighttime temperatures get below freezing. The dog is a short haired, medium sized dog who doesn\u2019t have the coat for cold weather. Dog is also not wearing any clothes and has a dog bed for comfort outside. I\u2019ve recently learned that if I yell \u201cshhh\u201d from my balcony, the dog will bark. I will do this until they wake up and bring their dog in. I assume they go right back to sleep and the dog doesn\u2019t come out until morning. It usually only takes about 5 minutes of this for them to bring the dog in. I do this because I feel bad for the dog being outside all night until pass sunrise. We have left a note on their door explaining how unfair it is to the dog to keep them outside but nothing has changed. We also have a useless leasing office that has done nothing for the dog. My husband pointed out tonight that I might be an a**hole for doing this around 1am or whenever I come out during the night and that I\u2019m probably waking others in the complex.

      "text": "A bit of context:I've been renting a place for the last 1.5 years. Its a 1 bedroom apartment with a hall.3 months ago my friend/senior from my company started living here. He said it was temporary but continued to live and I didn't say much because he was a senior at work and basically taught me my job (I was a fresher when i joined). 2 months ago I had to go to my hometown for more than a month and he didn't really find another place, so I asked him to pay half rent +  bills. He used to send me only half rent each month that too after me asking 4-5 times every time.So today I informed him that I wanted to empty the flat as I was moving out of the city. He likes this place so he talked with the owner and agreed to stay here. He asked me if he could buy some furniture from me so I said okay and we agreed on a price. But as always he's not paying me any money and I feel like I've been taken advantage of. He already owes me 5k (Previous months bills) + 6k for the furniture he supposedly bought from me. I came home today and emptied all my stuff which included the furniture and my own stuff and left. (I had warned him that if he doesn't pay by the time the packers and movers come I'll take all of it). He went directly to work without paying. AITA?Edit: This amount is in Indian Rupees. So Rs. 11000 = 140$",

      "text": "Hi all,So I live in a block of 9 flats, and have lived here for about 5 years. The flats themselves are around 7 years old.I'm lucky enough to own my flat, and the block itself is a mixture of renters and owners. The flats are however, all leasehold.Every flat has a similar layout. They have two beds, with a main bathroom, and one ensuite. The living room and kitchen are open plan. Each flat has two assigned parking spaces.Now in the current climate (UK based), the flats aren't selling too well despite being in a very desirable area of London. One of our neighbours who owns his flat, has therefore decided to rent it out so that he can move to a larger property. My issue is, he has decided he wants to maximise his profit and to do this he has converted the living room into a third bedroom.This doesn't sit well with me at all and I'm pretty sure he can't legally do it. Firstly, I think it's pretty shitty to convert the living room and leave the renters with one small kitchen as the only communal space. I really don't like the idea of him maximising his profit at others expense and creating overcrowding. Secondly, this is a block full of couples and families. I'm concerned that if more and more people start doing this it changes the demographic. Then there's just the issues of having multiple people In one flat. More cars which the block doesn't have space for, more noise from the occupants etc etc.He has managed to successfully get some renters as the rental market is booming but they haven't moved in yet. I'm very tempted to make some enquiries to the freeholder and the council about his set up, but if it is illegal (which I strongly suspect it is) then I'd not only lose this guy his renters, but he'd have to put everything back at expense. Alternatively, I could just let it go.So WIBTA if I reported him?Edit to add: I can accept the asshole judgement, thats what I came here for...but Jesus I don't need to be reported by a concerned redditor for suicide watch you weirdos.",

There\u2019s a set of bars and poles for people to use for exercise, but I\u2019m the only person I\u2019ve seen use them. When I\u2019m exercising I\u2019m moving a lot because I try to keep it high intensity. I\u2019m listening to music also. Sometimes this dog walker group come to the park and they sit and drink coffee and chat on some benches near the exercise area (roughly 20m away.) Today as I was exercising I felt someone tap/hit my arm and noticed that an older gentleman was trying to get my attention. I pulled out my headphones immediately and asked what was wrong and he started shouting at me for ignoring him. I apologized and said I couldn\u2019t hear him due to the music. I noticed that 4 of the 6 dogs in this group were going a bit bonkers, barking and trying to pull away from their owners, and the older gentleman started telling me how it was my fault and I was winding the dogs up and the same thing had happened last week. I said that it wasn\u2019t my intention and that I was just trying to exercise. He told me to exercise elsewhere. I said that this was the closest place to do it to my home and I\u2019m free to exercise when I want. I then asked what time and day the walkers come and I can try and get to the park before they come, but the older fella said \u201cno, we don\u2019t need to tell you that. We don\u2019t want you in our park and if you keep causing trouble the police will be called.\u201d I feel bad for causing the group hassle, but at the same time, there are other benches in the park where they can sit also.*EDIT 1*To give some more context. This is not the US. Im not a POC, but I\u2019m a foreign resident living in Japan and I\u2019m considered a minority because of that.

This devastated him and left really deep scars. He was really unstable at middle+ high school and mom was also severely depressed and none of us were living in our hometown so we couldn't handle everything as we should but he managed to enter into one of the best universities in our country. After he got into the university, he started to be in the relationships with older guys. He was in the same city with me at this time, so I had the chance to have an eye on him. He wasn't in any bodily or academically harmed but all of this fucked him up really badly mentally and he was a mess until he met with Liam 11 years ago (53M).He was a widower(he lost his husband at 2010) and my brother fell in love with him instantly. He took him under his wings, protected him and nurtured him. I was also suspicious of their relationship first but as the time passed, I saw the realness ,the authenticity, the loyality, the love. My brother was happy but the other family members never approved this relationship, accused Liam of being a predator so he got C&amp;D orders for harassment and I was the only one with my family(my 4 year old was a flower girl) in their wedding in 2018 other than our mother, who had dementia at that time and we lost her the next year. I also cut my siblings out of our lives after our moms funeral.At the beginning of 2021,we learned my brother had cancer, the same one with our father. He was early diagnosed and had the surgery but it returned 18 months later and spread fast. Chemo didn't work and at Christmas Eve, he gave his final breath while we were there.My brother asked his funeral to be organized as we seem fit and said \"please don't do anything will make you uncomfortable for anyone.\" We didn't invite our siblings. Liam's family and my ILs were there but no one from my family was invited,they learned my brother's death after his death was announced at our home towns facebook page. My siblings were mad and they tried to reach Liam via his lawyer but they couldn't so they reached out to me.I told them they deserved this after all they did and they should be glad we are not charging them with harassment with the heat of the moment but after time passed,I feel really guilty about saying this.

To that end, we both have our own full bathrooms.One of my biggest pet peeves about living with my wife is that she legitimately does not *see* the messes she makes. I can overlook this in most areas except water.  If she turns on a faucet anywhere, going behind her is like following a dog that violently shook itself off.  Every time she takes a shower, she leaves 10-15 feet worth of soggy footprints and drips everywhere she's been.  I have slipped in her wake more than once.This is why I *can't* share a bathroom with her.The issue is that she will use whatever bathroom is closest, which is often mine.  I *never* use hers, but I usually just shrug it off because I'm not the potty police.  However, every time she washes her hands, she leaves a mess.I have told her multiple times to please not splash water everywhere.  She will apologize, then continue to do it.  I know she's not doing it intentionally.  I know she doesn't *see* it.  But it has to stop.Today, I went into the bathroom behind her and stepped in a puddle.  There was another puddle on the countertop that was dripping onto the rug.  The mirror was splashed with water literally up to my eye level.  My toothbrush was wet.  The tissue box was wet.  There was a mass of soap foam in the sink.  All because she had washed her face.I called her into the bathroom and told her that if she can't not do this, she can't use my bathroom.She got upset and said she wouldn't use it anymore.1.  I don't believe her.  I think she'll just forget and keep using it.2.  I seriously wouldn't mind if she didn't leave a water hazard behind her, but she's made it clear that she cannot abide by that.3. If I asked her to clean it up, she would, but she would not do it to my standards, because *she cannot see the mess*. I feel bad for upsetting her and I know that she's sensitive to criticism and judgment, but I don't feel like this is an unreasonable ask.Am I the asshole?",

She started making acid comments towards my work, and how I am just a rip-off and a scammer, because I work multiple fields, it angered me but whatever, I was too busy to bicker aroundWhen time to leave rolled up, she took me aside and started berating me, saying I should stop scamming people, and lying to my family about what I do, saying my work is just a ruse and implying I sell drugs or have an OF (I love the idea), she ended up calling me a mercenary and laughing at me.

For the record, he isn't autistic and does not technically have a speech delay.Side note: she has another friend that has helped her during times we weren't speaking, fully due to her own behavior and past abusive outbursts towards me, and she has informed me she'll be naming the baby after her. Personally I don't care, but why tell me? to hurt my feelings?Now we're at the invitations for her baby shower; something else she didn't even think to do with me, I didn't have one, and she asked me to fly out for that.

He stayed in bed all day while I looked after both kids. I made sure he was left alone so he could sleep. Mid afternoon I asked if he would be well enough to look after his daughter that night, as I was taking my son back to his Dads, and i wouldn't be home. He initially says yes, but then later on he makes it pretty clear he is very unwell and its likely gastro.I suggested he organise for his daughter to go home then, as a) its friggin contagious and b) if its gastro he'd still be out for the count Monday and I'd be on duty to take care of her while I work (I WFH and don't get the day off), and likely have to drive her to her mum on Monday. I even offered to drive her back the whole way on Sunday afternoon instead of her mum needing to come meet us halfway as she usually does.He is angry that I would suggest that, as his time with her is extremely limited as it is since the mother moved out of town with his daughter. He said he might be feeling okay Monday and then still get to spend the day with her and didn't want to risk losing that day with her, which I do understand. But there was an expectation from him that I cancel my plans and stay to look after her because he is sick and needed my help.I offered him an alternative - if he's too sick to take care of her, I will take her home so you don't have to, and so I can keep my plans. We had an argument, I said (quite angrily) that his daughter isn't my responsibility, and so I left and went to my dinner. He was angry, I was angry. We absolutely do not see eye to eye on this. If I were in dire straights and he had plans, I'd organise for my sons father to have him as i wouldnt EXPECT my partner to take responsibility here, but it is different as I see my son whenever I want and have him far more often. Losing a day here and there isn't a big deal for me like it is for my bf, and he expected me - as his partner - to cancel my plans and take care of his daughter so he could have more time with her.AITA for feeling like I shouldn't be expected to sacrifice my plans I made 3 weeks earlier that were important to me, and stay home and look after his daughter/help him instead?",

For example, when we leave the house for several hours, she will ask me whether our dog will be alright (while we\u2019re gone). When I provide an honest answer (\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d), she becomes extremely hostile and upset toward me. Therefore, my lone option is to say, \u201cyes,\u201d or else an argument will ensue. Obviously, I suspect our dog will be fine, but cannot guarantee it (e.g., house fire, burglars, etc). It is an average dog being left alone in an average home located in an average neighborhood.The question irritates me because I have no additional insight into whether our dog will be alright. My wife knows that. I am not veterinarian, nor can I see into the future. So, why continue to ask me the same asinine question?Accordingly, AITA for responding with, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d",
