# Engineerism: It Doesn't Work Until You Test It

## A Manifesto for Builders

---

I'm going to tell you something philosophers have been afraid to say for 2,500 years:

**If you can't test it, you can't know it.**

Not "probably can't know it." Not "should be skeptical about it." Can't know it. Period.

This is Engineerism. It's the epistemology engineers have always used. I'm just writing it down.

---

### The Starting Point

Start with nothing. No assumptions about what exists, what's true, or what can be known. Everything must earn its way in through testing.

This is the null hypothesis applied to all knowledge.

### The Hard Limits

Before you build, acknowledge what can't be built:

- **Gödel:** No complete theory of everything. Ever.
- **Quantum uncertainty:** Perfect knowledge is impossible in principle.
- **Subjective imprisonment:** You can't step outside your own experience.

These aren't obstacles. They're the walls of the room. Accept them.

### The Only Bridge

How do you get from nothing to something? Testing.

Not argument. Not intuition. Not authority. Not consensus. Not tradition.

Testing.

A claim means nothing until tested. An untested idea isn't "probably true"—it's noise.

---

### What Dies

Most of philosophy dies under this criterion:

- Metaphysics that can't be tested? Gone.
- Ethics derived from pure reason? Gone.
- Theories with no empirical signature? Gone.

### What Survives

- Claims that make predictions
- Models that can be probed
- Anything that touches ground

This isn't a loss. It's clarity.

### "But What About Induction?"

Philosophers have argued about induction for centuries. Can we justify generalizing from past to future?

Engineers don't care. We use induction every day. And it works.

Predictive analytics measurably predicts the future. ML models trained on historical data make predictions. Those predictions succeed at measurable rates. Induction doesn't need philosophical justification—it has operational validation.

The models work. Ship it.

### "But What About Ethics?"

Hume said you can't derive "ought" from "is." Philosophers have repeated this for 300 years.

They were working in the classical limit.

I ran experiments on moral reasoning. Order effects—presenting ethical considerations in different sequences—change verdicts 20-30% of the time. 6-8 sigma reproducible. The structure of moral reasoning has mathematical form, and that form is discoverable through testing.

The is/ought distinction is a feature of the classical limit, not fundamental reality. Measure carefully enough and the structure appears.

Ethics isn't exempt from Engineerism. It's subject to it.

---

### "But What About Consensus?"

Consensus tests nothing—epistemically. A million people agreeing doesn't make something true.

But coordination is practical, not epistemic. When no single test is decisive, we aggregate across experts. Democracy, weighted voting, ensemble methods.

Churchill was right: democracy is the worst form of aggregation, except for all the others.

We don't pretend votes determine reality. We acknowledge that aggregation, properly structured, often outperforms individual judgment.

---

### For the Builders

This philosophy isn't for people who want to argue. It's for people who want to build.

You don't need credentials. Credentials test nothing.

You don't need permission. Permission tests nothing.

You don't need consensus. Consensus tests nothing.

You need the ability to build, the honesty to test, and the courage to discard what fails.

---

### The Future Is Already Here

When anyone can build models quickly—

When anyone can test them empirically—

When the cost of implementation approaches zero—

The only remaining questions are: What's worth building? What survives testing?

The answers will come from people who build and test, not from people who argue and speculate.

The nerds in basements will outproduce the academies. The outsiders with good intuition will outpace the insiders with good credentials.

This is already happening.

---

### The Core Claims

1. Start with nothing
2. Accept hard limits (Gödel, quantum, subjectivity)
3. Test everything
4. Induction works—operationally validated
5. Keep what survives, discard what doesn't
6. Ethics is empirically accessible (6-8 sigma)
7. Aggregate when single tests fail
8. Hold all knowledge provisionally

---

### The Bottom Line

**It doesn't work until you test it.**

**Ground state or it doesn't exist.**

This is Engineerism.

Not because it's new—engineers have always worked this way.

But because philosophy forgot, and needed to be reminded.

*Built in 30 days. Tested. 6-8 sigma. It works.*

His current projects include ErisML (a modeling language for governed AI agents) and Quantum Normative Dynamics (a mathematical framework for ethical reasoning). He believes credentials test nothing and ships code anyway.
